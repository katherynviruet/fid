<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

<p>We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>

<p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>

<p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>
	
<h2>Honey Fried Chicken</h2>

<p>Come taste our delicious honey fried chicken, which is seasoned with garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and paprika and served with golden mashed potatoes and gravy.</p>
	
<h2> Tabouleh</h2>
<img src="Exercise 07-03/responsivegallery/tabouleh-800.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>If you haven't already, now is the time to try tabouleh. Chef Jen's garden provides the basis for our tabouleh. Tabbouleh is a Levantine salad made with tomatoes, mint, onion, bulgur, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Some variations include adding lettuce or replacing bulgur with semolina.</p>	
	
<h2> Fresh Cut French Fries</h2>
<img src="Exercise 07-03/responsivegallery/fries-800.jpg" alt=""/>
<p> Our french fries are very long and well-cut, with a satisfying crunch. Our potatoes are grown naturally in Chef Jen's farm, and the only ingredients we use in our fries are salt and oil.
